Python Homework

PyBank:
Like with VBA, I am struggling with the script verbiage that delineates the rows in such a way that I can determine greatest increase/decrease. I will set up a tutorial session.


PyPoll:
This assignment was easier, as it followed a class example more closely than PyBank. The issue with this assignment is the size of the data. The program didn’t seem to be able to get through the code to show me my results, due to the amount of data necessary to count the vote total.
